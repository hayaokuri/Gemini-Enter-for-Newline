# UserScript: Gemini: Enter for Newline, Shift+Enter to Send

**Make your typing experience in Gemini more comfortable and intuitive!**

This UserScript modifies the default keyboard behavior in the Google Gemini web UI on PC. Instead of `Enter` sending your message, this script allows for more standard chat-like input:

* Press `Enter`: Inserts a **new line**.
* Press `Shift` + `Enter`: **Sends** the message.

This makes it easier to compose multi-line prompts and messages without accidentally sending them prematurely.

## ✨ Key Features

* Use `Enter` for a new line in Gemini's chat input field.
* Use `Shift` + `Enter` to send your message.
* Specifically designed for the PC (desktop browser) version of the Gemini website (`https://gemini.google.com/app*`).

## 🚀 How to Install

1.  **You need a UserScript Manager:**
    * If you don't have one already, install a UserScript manager for your browser. Popular choices include:
        * [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) (for Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari, Opera, etc.)
        * [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/) (for Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.)
        * [Greasemonkey](https://www.greasespot.net/) (for Firefox)

2.  **Install this UserScript:**
    * Click the link below to go to the script's page on Greasy Fork, then click the "Install this script" button and follow your UserScript manager's prompts.
        * ➡️ **[Install from Greasy Fork](https://greasyfork.org/ja/scripts/536815-gemini-enter-for-newline-shift-enter-to-send)**
        *(Note: The Greasy Fork page might initially appear in Japanese, but the script itself includes English metadata).*

After installation, simply open or reload the Gemini website, and the script will be active.

## 🛠️ How to Use

Once the script is installed and active on the Gemini page:

* To insert a **new line** while typing your message: Press the `Enter` key.
* To **send** your message: Press `Shift` + `Enter`.

No other configuration is needed!

## 📝 Notes

* **Website Updates:** Google may update the Gemini website, which could potentially break this script if the underlying HTML structure changes. If this happens, the script may need an update.
* **Extension Conflicts:** While unlikely, conflicts with other browser extensions or UserScripts that modify keyboard input are possible. If you experience issues, try temporarily disabling other extensions to isolate the cause.
* **Desktop Focus:** This script is primarily designed and tested for desktop browser use.
